    "### Understanding definition of Survival function and Hazard function and censorship?\n",
    "    survival function -> S(t) = P(T < t) \n",
    "        where survival function gives us the \"probability of survival after time t\" and here T is a random lifetime taken from the       population and it should be positive.\n",

    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "h(t) = \\lim_{\\delta t\\to 0}\\frac{P(t\\leq T \\leq t | T \\le t)}{\\delta t}\n",

    "        When deltaT goes to zero implies to the risk of event happening at point of time.\n",
    "    Censorship :\n",
    "        Censorship allows us to measure lifetime for the population who haven't experienced the event.\n",

    "### How i selected the feature?\n",
    "    It is always important to preprocess the data before feeding it to the model.\n",
    "    I used correlation to identify the features and i have also used the features that are specified in the challenge page \n",
    "    As you can see i have attached correlation heat map of all the features.\n",

    "### Explanation on  data preprocessing before fitting it to the model?\n",
    "    step 1: Load data from provided csv files \n",
    "    step 2: Feature selection using correlation (we can also use wrapping method and Embedded method) \n",
    "    step 3: Fill up the missing values\n",
    "            Only one feature \"age\" had missing values so i used mean values of column age to fill the missing values. \n",
    "    step 4: Transform the data \n",
    "            I have transformed \"sourceDataset\" feature because it is categorical (using LabelEncoder)\n",
    "    step 4:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Note : I did't performed any distribution of data because it's already distributed and i did'nt perform any scaling (or) Normalization on the data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Fitting the model and concordance index\n",
    "    I used 'SurvivalTime' as duration and 'Event' as event\n",
    "    Resulted concordance index : 0.70\n",
    "    \n",
    "![Correlation with selected features](./concordance_index.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Propotional Hazard assumptions?\n",
    "    I used Schoenfeld residuals to check the propotional Hazard assumptions.\n",
    "    The above data has satisfied the propotional hazard assumptions.(you can see in the code what happens if we increase the p-threshold\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Resulting Predictions?\n",
    "     I have attached a predictions.csv file of the test predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note : We can also use Neural Networks for the data but the data is too small so it would't make any change in the results (CNN) for convolutional Neural Networks we need large amount of data so i haven't test this on Neural Networks and CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note : I have tested same data with AalenAdditiveFitter and i got concordance index of 0.69"
